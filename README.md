# send_file_using_localhost
send files without cable and internet using a simple local host script
 how to use the server :
   1- open the script and rename < filename > at 6th row with your actuall file name 
( note that if you dont have the file in the same directory as server file than you must provide full path instead of only filename )
   2- run the server
   3- send a GET request( however you want, if you dont know how i'll explain it )
   4- your file is being downloaded
    thanks for using this script, give a star in github if you've enjoyed it <3

HOW TO SEND A GET REQUEST :
  - USING BROWSER : open your browser and enter this as your address : localhost:5000
  - USING Curl : check if you have curl, than use this command : curl localhost:5000
